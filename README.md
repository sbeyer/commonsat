# CommonSAT

CommonSAT is intended as a common C++11 SAT solver interface for different SAT solvers.

It is a header-only library, providing a common interface for
 - [ ] reading CNFs in DIMACS format
 - [ ] writing CNFs in DIMACS format
 - [ ] generating CNF formulaes
 - [ ] solving them (sequentially)
 - [ ] solving them in parallel
 - [ ] obtaining satisfiability or non-satisfiability information
 - [ ] obtaining a satisfiable assignment (if satisfiable)
 - [ ] obtaining conflict information (if non-satisfiable)
 - [ ] obtaining information about the computation
 - [ ] freezing and thawing variables for incremental computations
for SAT solver libraries like
 - [ ] MiniSAT
 - [ ] CryptoMiniSat
 - [ ] Lingeling
 - [ ] Plingeling
 - [ ] Treengeling
 - [ ] PicoSat
 - [ ] PrecoSat
 - [ ] YALS

Note that the things mentioned above are TODO list items that are probably not
implemented.
